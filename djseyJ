So I am DJ SeyJ Mandem, a new and young dj in Ghana. A university student doing Cybersecurity in GCTU. i will complete in 2029 by God's help and mercy.
I want a website where I will show case my mixtapes, Post them, showcase my works, I do Web Development too. I am curious and inspired. Talking about showcasing my mixes and development and files in the djing industry. I want to also appear on google search like how when you search people's name, then they will appear on google search and other search engines highlighting their real names and informations that is relevant.

I don't know if I can monitize some of my contents to promote myself financially. 

In all, I just want a presence online that ranks higher in SEO or searches too. I am very optimistic that I wil become like Dj Khaled , or Dj Sonatty. 
My real name is Karl Seyram , and I am 18 years now. Sounds fun and interesting too. I don't know if I can get a page or website to post and the rest. Maybe I can blog as well. 

Which you can also allow sharing to social media platforms when I upload mixes or Images or the rest. Like real logos of the platforms . I will include my logo as well for you to see and my image too. Recently I built 2 open source projects for cyber purposes, RedSentinel and SentinelX to help cyber experts perform work easily.

I have also created websites for a cleaning company(MiCleans) and a coorperate security company(SRI Holdings Limited) which are all live and working fine. I need money and yes, if there is any way to monitize site and stuffs. It will be fun.

Note: You can add any feature that will be necessary for the site and keep it through seo ranks and become popular , hahahahaha. Sounds fun, right?
